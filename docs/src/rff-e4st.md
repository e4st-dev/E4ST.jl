RFF-E4ST
========
Resources for the Future (RFF), the main organization responsible for developing and maintaining E4ST.jl, has a carefully curated a set of inputs and assumptions that we use in our analyses.  With the E4ST.jl writing process, we have tried to make our model straight-forward and easy to pick up and use for other modelers.  However, many of the inputs we use for our analyses are proprietary and require a license.  There are also custom Modifications that are still in development, or project-specific that we have chosen not to release in E4ST.jl.  If you are interested in using our inputs (possibly necessitating a licensing fee paid to the data providers), please contact Dan Shawhan at shawhan@rff.org.  This page provides an overview of the inputs and assumptions we use for our analyses.
